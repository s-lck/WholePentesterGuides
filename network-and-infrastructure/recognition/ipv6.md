### **IPv6**

* IPV6 port scan: `sudo nmap -p- -6 --min-rate 10000 <IPv6>`

Since Windows Vista/Server 2008, IPV6 is enabled and prefered than IPv4. The point of the attack is to abuse the IPv6 configuration spoofing the DNS replies acting as a malicious DNS server

* Install [MiTM6](https://github.com/fox-it/mitm6), this tool target only Windows based system
* Listen with Wireshark for IPv6 configuration resquest, using `DHCPv6`
