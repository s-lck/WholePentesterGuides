# Brute force

First, you can use password database to test the most used password.

* There is a lot of database compilation of the most used password online. You can use one of your choice
  * `rockyou`
  * `seclists`
* Then you can build your own password databases depending on the context of your mission (company name, year, place ...).
  * It happen that the user use guessing pattern according to their working context to create their passwords. For example, you will find the name of company following by the current year and a star.
    *   In the point to generate the list :

        `john --wordlist=<WORDLIST> --rules:all --stdout > <OUTPUTFILE.TXT>`

        * The file `<WORDLIST>` should contain few words as `CompanynameYear*`, `CompanynameYear!` and `CompanynameYear` `john` will generate hundred of word drifting from them, by changing lowercase to uppercase, turning symbolics and numbers ...
    * Once the wordlist ready, you can use `hydra` - `patator`
