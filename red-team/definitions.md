### Red Team

> A red team is an organization tasked with the duty of becoming a thinking enemy in order to test the physical, digital and social aspects of a company's security. Red team must think and act as an adversary

> Red Teaming is the process of using tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat, with the goal of measuring the effectiveness of the people, processes and technologies used to defend an environment. Red teams provide an adversarial perspective by attacking assumptions made by an organization and defenders.

### OPSEC

### Organisation

* Have a plan
  * Search weaknesses on it
  * Point missed
  * Fresh eyes
* Tenth man rule -> /!\ Groupthink errors
  * First team present results to second team for advice
  * Second team present results to first team for advices
  * Get a stronger plan
* Read Team the plan
  * Identify risks, threat & vulnerabilities
  * Assign importance & likelihood
  * Prioritize
  * /!\ failure equipment
    * 2 c'est 1
    * 1 c'est rien
* Have a PLAN / a BACKUP plan / ESCAPE plan
* Faire un _dry run_
* Murphy's law: _If something can go wrong, it will go wrong_
* Which attacker do you want to model ?
* What level of subtely can your defenders notice ?&#x20;
  * HTTP vs SSH vs DNS
  * HTTP POST vs HTTP GET
* How long of an engagement is most useful for you
* Read about adversaries
  * What they might want from you
* Ways RT fail&#x20;
  * Insufficient managment support
  * Overly constrained
  * Communication failures
    * Humiliate guy you are helping
    * Overwhelm the defenders
  * Creativity failure
    * Lack of diversity&#x20;
    * Too integrated in organization
    * Insufficiently knowedgable about organization
    * Get to confortable with you tools/style
    * Assume ATTACKERS think like you
* Building / using a Red Team&#x20;

  * Keep team independant/protected from functions they are red teaming
  * Make sure everyone understand that the RT is not the real enemy
  * Constant training&#x20;
  * Know when to stop&#x20;
  * Good at finding logic flaw&#x20;
  * Strong expertise in something&#x20;
  * Read CONSTANTLY about adversaries&#x20;
    * Technical, business priorities …
* Attacker simulation suggestions&#x20;
  * Be rigorous when defining the attacker
  * Parteners with defenders
  * MINDSET > Technical knowledge
  * Reward defenders who find you
