# Threat - Scenarios - TTP - IOC

> The biggest challenge in threat emulation is executing to a level where an analyst believes the threat is real

## ThÃ©orie

### Threat emulation

> Process of mimicking the TTPs of a specific threat

Threats:

* Script-kiddies
* Specific threat
  * DDoS
  * Ransomware
* APT

Threat emulation:

* Can be a specif threat (tool & group)
* General threat

### Scenario models

#### Full engagement model

End-to-end emulation of a threat, begins from the outside of the organization

* Need to get in or have a backup plan
* Phases
  * Get In
  * Stay In
  * Act

#### Assumed breach model

Assumes that the threat has access to the target organization at the start of the mission

* Begins after initial breach
* Phases
  * Stay in
  * Act

> Waiting for evidence of a breach causes companies to reveal not only that they have been compromised but that they have been compromised for years.

#### Custom scenario model

Test on a specific areas of the target

* Can start at any level of the threat cycle

### TTP & IOC

> Artifacts (bits of information) that identify or describe threat actions.

Including

* Network traffic
* User activity
* Connections for a specific country
* Database reads
* File change or modifications
* Actions (or attempts of)
* (D)DoS

Red team generates `IOC `- Blue team identify `IOC`

`TTP` leads to `IOC `- Both need to be fully controlled by RTO
