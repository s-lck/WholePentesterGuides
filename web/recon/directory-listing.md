# Directory listing

## Method

* `gobuster -u <IP> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -s '200,204,301,302,307,403,500' -e`
  * Add `-k` due to https protocol
* `dirb <IP> /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
* Wordlists :
  * dirb : `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb`
  * wfuzz : `/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist`
  * seclist : `/usr/share/seclists`
* Start with a little one as `common`, then a biggest then a wordlist dedicated to a technology (IIS, Apache, nginx ...)
* Start enumerate on **subfolders** AND **files**
  * Ex: Start on
    * Then on `<ip>/sub-folder`
    * Then on `<ip>/index.php`
* When you find a file start enumerate the extension
  * Wordlists :
    * `/opt/wordlists/ContentDiscovery/common-extensions.txt`
    * `/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/extensions_common.txt`
    * `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/extensions_common.txt`
      * Ex: `.php~` -> backup for PHP file, could leak the source code
* Acces to a Git repo
